# Simulation of a gamma oscillation using the Hodgkin and Huxley model | Neuromatch Academy 2020: Computational Neuroscience Summer Course |  Interactive Student

This analysis was done as the final project for the [2020 Neuromatch Academy-Computational Neuroscience](https://academy.neuromatch.io/nma2020) worldwide summer course.

Modeling gamma oscillations using the Hodgkin and Huxley model developed from studies in the relatively gigantic axon of a Squid. The code was written in Python using Google Colab by following/based on readings of [Introduction to Modeling Neuronal Dynamics book by Christoph BÃ¶rgers](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-51171-9) and with the guidance of Dr. Kresimir Josic, Professor from the Department of Mathematics at the University of Houston. 

## Ideas
Objective: Understand emergent network properties.
* How do neural oscillations emerge?
* Up and down states in the striatum.

## Contributions 
Some contributions and responsabilities were: 

1. Developed parts of code for the project. <br>
2. Organized, designed, and developed sections of the project. <br>
3. Presented the results to stakeholders and interdisciplinary audience. <br>
  
## Results 
We simulated a gamma oscillation by connecting an excitatory and an inhibitory cell using the Hodgkin and Huxley model.

## Our experience!

* Lots of meetings! <br>
* Hard to pin down a specific question (we learned so much in NMA!) <br>
* We were able to implement models that initally seemed really daunting.
