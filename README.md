# Simulation of a gamma oscillation using the Hodgkin and Huxley model | Neuromatch Academy 2020: Computational Neuroscience Summer Course |  Interactive Student
Modeling gamma oscillations using the Hodgkin and Huxley model developed from studies in the relatively gigantic axon of a Squid. The code was written in Python using Google Colab. By: Daniela Monje, Lorenzo Gutierrez, Alex Legaria, and Yeselth Angarita-Peña. Based on the reading of Introduction to Modeling Neuronal Dynamics book by Christoph Börgers and the mentorship of Dr. Kresimir Josic, Professor from the Department of Mathematics at the University of Houston. 

# Ideas
<br>
Objective: Understand emergent network properties.
<br>
<br>
* How do neural oscillations emerge?
<br>
* Up and down states in the striatum.

# Contributions 
<br> 
My contributions and responsabilities were: 

<br> 
1. Developed parts of code for the project. <br>
2. Organized, designed, and developed sections of the project. <br>
3. Presented the results to stakeholders and interdisciplinary audience. <br>

  
# Results 
<br> 
We simulated a gamma oscillation by connecting an excitatory and an inhibitory cell using the Hodgkin and Huxley model.


# Our experience!
<br>
* Lots of meetings! <br>
* Hard to pin down a specific question (we learned so much in NMA!) <br>
* We were able to implement models that initally seemed really daunting.

# Acknowledgement 
<br> 
All the project members contributed equally.
