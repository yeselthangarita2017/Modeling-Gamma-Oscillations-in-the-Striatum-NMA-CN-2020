Modeling gamma oscillations using Python and Google Colab. By: Daniela Monje, Lorenzo Gutierrez, Alex Legaria, and Yeselth Angarita-Peña. Based on the reading of Introduction to Modeling Neuronal Dynamics book by Christoph Börgers.

# Ideas
<br>
Objective: Understand emergent network properties.
* How do neural oscillations emerge?
* Up and down states in the striatum.

# Results 
<br> 
We simulated a gamma oscillation by connecting an excitatory and an inhibitory cell using the Hodgkin and Huxley model.


# Our experience!
<br>
* Lots of meetings!
* Hard to pin down a specific question (we learned so much in NMA!) 
* We were able to implement models that inially seemed really daunting.
